&lt;figcaption&gt;Translation from main thread: &lt;i&gt;If I'm a (female) engineer, why in my diploma, it says (male) 'engineer'?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Translation from comment below: &lt;i&gt;I don't know if 160 people like this because of its level of ridiculousness, or because they agree with the complaint. Anyways, I think that's a fuck-around post, I refuse to believe someone seriously posted this bullshit, hahahahaha.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with this, Spanish language is gender-nominative by default. We have, in some instances, deal with gender nouns when available, when in English, that's not necessary (at least, in situations like that). As an example, the word 'engineer' can mean any male or female; while in Spanish, we have to point exactly what one means. However, in formal terms, the gender is meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's the point of this? Some people, like that girl, is overreacting on topics like this. From times and times ago, the term &lt;em&gt;&lt;abbr title="(Male) engineer."&gt;ingeniero&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is always used in formal documents like a diploma, but it doesn't address to a gender in particular. However, some people like her, doesn't get that. Because of that, feminism is misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, this is why I prefer &lt;abbr title="Advocates equality of rights for everyone, no matter the gender."&gt;egalitarism&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answering the question, sexism is on an only place: on some people's minds that doesn't what feminism really means. Persons that think there's a &lt;abbr title="Patriarchy, patriarchy everyhwere."&gt;patriarchy&lt;/abbr&gt; because of a (simple) male noun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is what I believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="/images/iquique_family.jpg" width="360" title="My northern family" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;My northern family&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well... as some people (closer to me) knows, I was born in Iquique in 1986. Because of some things of the life, I moved to Ovalle when was 3 months. After that, I got back to the north in February, 1994. I was 7 yet, but I was able to understand some things about my origins. 21 years later, &lt;abbr title="Yes, here in Chile, it's summer, when in northern countries, it's winter. Yes, Christmastime is very hot here."&gt;in past summer&lt;/abbr&gt;, I got back again, and noticed how the family grew up, and it's still going on that. Lots of emotions came here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I recently went to Iquique, all parties are in family. So I'll go frequently. (No, La Serena and Ovalle won't be forgotten!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My birth place itself grew up, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found some things I must noticed before, and changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My family is of &lt;abbr title="A minoritary ethnic group which people can be found in the Greater North of Chile, in Southern Peru, and Bolivia. They live mostly in the Andean high plains, a.k.a Altiplano."&gt;Aymara&lt;/abbr&gt; descent, so me too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have some cute (female) cousins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oneself can move easily within the city. Taxis are cheaper than in other cities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Culture itself is very closer to their Andean roots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The past year earthquake (May, 2014) still shows its scars. Things in Iquique are still not fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mayor is an asshole. (Well... that's not any novelty)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In summer, it's so hot, that I didn't need to turn the heater on. (Anyway, it's broken)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I want to go again, I hope it'd be for a month. And in aeroplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All my family (in both sides, maternal and fraternal) is very awesome. And things like that, make me worth them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XOXO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or so it must begin. Anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm starting this alternative blog because I want to try the benefits of &lt;a href="http://blog.getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a blog-oriented platform made in Python, what's my favourite programming language. Also, I want to improve my practice in English, so I'll write the posts in that language. Maybe I'll include some other languages, specially Spanish, my mother tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wait for a description about myself, it won't be here, but in a page that will be available... soon. Meanwhile, you can watch everything about me in &lt;a href="http://www.jorgicio.net"&gt;my personal site&lt;/a&gt; (in Spanish).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I may learn about this, and having some break, I'll be posting here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. Any suggestions are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
