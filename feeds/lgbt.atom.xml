&lt;p&gt;Translation of the note above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A FATHER HEARS HIS SON HOW DOES HE TELL HIM HAS A BOYFRIEND. HIS FATHER LEFT THIS NOTE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rub√©n:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night I heard the conversation you had with Miguel talking about your plans to tell me you're gay. The only thing you have to plan is to bring the bread when you come out from school, we're out (like you, now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned you were gay since you were 6 and I had loved you since you were born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.: Your mother and me think Miguel and you make a nice couple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True love knows neither about gender nor anything else. In USA, marriages for everyone are nationwide since June 26th, being same-sex or not. True love won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, also comes the support the LGBT marriages as a fashionable topic. I mean all those rainbow-tainted images in lots of avatars on social networks. Specially here in Chile. How ridiculous look all of those ones! You better celebrate when this happens here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I agree all people who want to marry do it whether they're the same gender or not, no matter who are. But I don't have to brag about it. Why I'd have to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, congrats, USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A greatest step forward to the progress. A breakthrough for Irish people, and they deserved it.
On May 22th, 2015, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/world/europe/ireland-gay-marriage-referendum.html?_r=0"&gt;Ireland became the 19th country in the world to approve the Gay Marriage&lt;/a&gt;, and the first one did it by referendum. An historical event for that country.
Congratulations, Irish people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Chile... when? At least, we have to be content with the Civil Union Agreement for a while. But we hope someday (sooner) every citizen people, &lt;abbr title="Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transsexuals. Genderqueer people also fits there."&gt;LGBT&lt;/abbr&gt; or not, to be happy. Also, we hope the same for Australian people.&lt;/p&gt;
