&lt;p&gt;Marchs are great events to express for an unfair government. Sadly, there are 2 kind of people that waste everything. On the one hand, there are the Special Forces, often mistaken with the &lt;em&gt;&lt;abbr title="The Chilean equivalent to the Police."&gt;Carabineros de Chile&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (there are some of the latest ones that repress, though), commanded by the Minister of the Interior. On the other hand, there are the &lt;em&gt;&lt;abbr title="Lumpenproletariat, German term used for that people does not do something productive for the life, and some of them waste everything."&gt;lumpen&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and the hooded ones that destroy everything in their wake. They think doing that put things right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a revolutionary that some people we are, condemn those acts of violence, wherever it may come from, and wherever it may go to. We don't want more dead or wounded people just for marching. Don't let bullet makes us be silenced, because they won't!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This for Diego, Exequiel, for Rodrigo, and any other one that died or injured for expressing what they felt. For the fallen ones in the Pino-shit dictatorship!

&lt;img src="http://jorgicio.github.io/images/feminism.png" title="Dafuq?" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Translation from main thread: &lt;i&gt;If I'm a (female) engineer, why in my diploma, does it say (male) 'engineer'?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Translation from comment below: &lt;i&gt;I don't know if 160 people like this because of its level of ridiculousness, or because they agree with the complaint. Anyways, I think that's a fuck-around post, I refuse to believe someone seriously posted this bullshit, hahahahaha.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with this, Spanish language is gender-nominative by default. We have, in some instances, deal with gender nouns when available, when in English, that's not necessary (at least, in situations like that). As an example, the word 'engineer' can mean any male or female; while in Spanish, we have to point exactly what one means. However, in formal terms, the gender is meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's the point of this? Some people, like that girl, is overreacting on topics like this. From times and times ago, the term &lt;em&gt;&lt;abbr title="(Male) engineer."&gt;ingeniero&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is always used in formal documents like a diploma, but it doesn't address to a gender in particular. However, some people like her, doesn't get that. Because of that, feminism is misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, this is why I prefer &lt;abbr title="Advocates equality of rights for everyone, no matter the gender."&gt;egalitarism&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answering the question, sexism is on an only place: on some people's minds that doesn't what feminism really means. Persons that think there's a &lt;abbr title="Patriarchy, patriarchy everyhwere."&gt;patriarchy&lt;/abbr&gt; because of a (simple) male noun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is what I believe in.&lt;/p&gt;
