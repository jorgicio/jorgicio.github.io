&lt;p&gt;Yes, you know, I submitted this blog to the &lt;a href="http://feedshark.brainbliss.com/"&gt;Feed Shark&lt;/a&gt; service, and they asked me to create a new post with this code, so... there it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="http://jorgicio.github.io/images/iquique_family.jpg" width="360" title="My northern family" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;My northern family&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well... as some people (closer to me) knows, I was born in Iquique in 1986. Because of some things of the life, I moved to Ovalle when was 3 months. After that, I got back to the north in February, 1994. I was 7 yet, but I was able to understand some things about my origins. 21 years later, &lt;abbr title="Yes, here in Chile, it's summer, when in northern countries, it's winter. Yes, Christmastime is very hot here."&gt;in past summer&lt;/abbr&gt;, I got back again, and noticed how the family grew up, and it's still going on that. Lots of emotions came here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I recently went to Iquique, all parties are in family. So I'll go frequently. (No, La Serena and Ovalle won't be forgotten!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My birth place itself grew up, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found some things I must noticed before, and changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My family is of &lt;abbr title="A minoritary ethnic group which people can be found in the Greater North of Chile, in Southern Peru, and Bolivia. They live mostly in the Andean high plains, a.k.a Altiplano."&gt;Aymara&lt;/abbr&gt; descent, so me too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have some cute (female) cousins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oneself can move easily within the city. Taxis are cheaper than in other cities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Culture itself is very closer to their Andean roots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The past year earthquake (May, 2014) still shows its scars. Things in Iquique are still not fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mayor is an asshole. (Well... that's not any novelty)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In summer, it's so hot, that I didn't need to turn the heater on. (Anyway, it's broken)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I want to go again, I hope it'd be for a month. And in aeroplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All my family (in both sides, maternal and fraternal) is very awesome. And things like that, make me worth them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XOXO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or so it must begin. Anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm starting this alternative blog because I want to try the benefits of &lt;a href="http://blog.getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a blog-oriented platform made in Python, what's my favourite programming language. Also, I want to improve my practice in English, so I'll write the posts in that language. Maybe I'll include some other languages, specially Spanish, my mother tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wait for a description about myself, it won't be here, but in a page that will be available... soon. Meanwhile, you can watch everything about me in &lt;a href="http://www.jorgicio.net"&gt;my personal site&lt;/a&gt; (in Spanish).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I may learn about this, and having some break, I'll be posting here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. Any suggestions are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
